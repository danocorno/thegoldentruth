							<h2 class="title">Welcome to The Golden Truth</h2>
							<div class="entry">
								<p><img src="images/collage.jpg" width="500" height="221" alt="" />The Golden Truth is a documentary film that will change the way the world sees pediatric oncology. Childhood cancer has been mispotrayed by the media for years. The pictures of smiling bald children that we see online make it easy for people to forget the battles that these kids are facing. Often, people don't realize that the medicines being pumped into children are dangerous chemicals at levels intended for adults. People don't see kids vomiting until they're too tired to move. People don't realize that children fighting cancer are fighting for their lives. We believe that it is important to show the beeping machines and the sad faces, not because we want to see it- but because we want to change it. After all, you can’t fix a problem unless you know it’s there. Our film will uncover the shocking truth about pediatric cancer, and offer hope to those in the fight. <a href="about.html">(read more)</a></p>
