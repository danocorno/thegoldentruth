                                <br/>
								<p style="font-size:20px"> </p><p>2015 has been filled with bad news. As of today at least 43,250 children have died from cancer, and to me it feels like more. I can't scroll through any form of social media without reading about a child's funeral, hospice care plan, or relapse. At first I thought this overwhelming amount of bad news was me getting more immersed in this community. But it's not. Pediatric cancer incidence rates are climbing, and so are the number of deaths. The treatments we're using to kill childhood cancer are giving kids more cancer. (Yes, you did read that correctly. Cancer treatments are causing secondary cancer.) And if it's not another cancer, it's heart disease, kidney failure, immune difficiancies, the list goes on. The other day, I had a kid tell me that they felt better before their tumor was found, because the pain from that was less than the pain caused by chemo. That's absolutely unacceptable, and I could list off a million statistics about why! But I'm not going to do that, because these kids are not statistics. They're kids. <br/> 
                                
This month, several of the children I work with have died. Most of them suffered through years of agressive treatment and relapses with admirable strength. I am thankful that I experienced the joy of their friendship, and the heartbreak of loosing them. Each of them shaped my character, the direction of this film, and my overall outlook on life. They didn't take anything for granted. They loved unconditionally. They forgave quickly. They had all the qualities I strive to have. I wanted to put off writing this post, because describing them in the past tense makes it all the more real that they're gone. But it is real. They were real. And just because they WERE doesn't make them less real than when they ARE. They were real children, with real families and real friends. They are just as real now as they were when they were alive, because each of them made an impact on the world that can't be replaced. Statistics can be anyone. Just meaningless numbers on a page predicting the death of more children. Children with hopes and dreams, who will never live to fufill them. Children with families who love them. Children who will make a mark on their world just as my friends did.<br/>

Because of cancer and its treatments, 250 children died today. 250 children will die tomorrow. And 250 children will die every day after that until we find a cure. I wouldn't be surprised if the statistics next year are higher. They will continue to rise as long as we look at them like statistics. 250 is a number. Rachel Henley was a person. She was 1 of 250 on June 2, 2015. Rachel loved to create. She took beautiful photography, designed elegant interiors, and kept an inspiring blog about her cancer journey. Take one look at her website, at her talent, and call her a statistic. You can't, because she was incredible. She still is incredible. She wasn't just some kid who got cancer and died. She was an artist, a role model, an inspiration.<br/>

Jennie Nichols was a person. She was 1 of 250 on June 20, 2015. Jennie was hilarious. She had a sense of humor like no other patient I have met. She was an absolute joy to talk to. Her faith was awe-inspiring. She had the most giving heart, going out of her way for others whenever she could. She will never graduate from high school, get married, or have children. Could you look into the eyes of Jennie's middle school class and tell them that their friend was just a statistic? Could you tell her parents that their 15 year old girl is a number on a research sheet? Could you say that about a 15 year old who raised awareness for a killer disease, inspired thousands- while fighting for her life?<br/>

Makinley Rain Morris was a person. She was 1 of 250 on May 28, 2015. Makinley was so sweet. She loved her family and they all fought together. Makinley's slogan was "nobody fights alone" and she certainly didn't. Her mother, father, sister, and brothers were a support system like no other. She had an entire community fighting with her, and she sent support right back, reaching out to others whenever she could. She was encouraging, wise beyond her years, and so compassionate. There is nothing you could say to her community that would make her a statistic. She touched so many lives, and her story will surely continue to.<br/>

I could write a book in this format, telling you about incredible children and explaining to you their gifts and talents. I could tell you about the joy each of them brought to this world, about the irreplaceable light they were to this world of darkness. One paragraph is simply not enough to sum up my love for these girls and so many more that died recently. But I'm going to make a film, a film filled with kids who are "statistics". Some are survivors, some are fighting, and some have died. But once you see them, you'll understand. They're so much more than numbers. We alll have something to offer in the world, and they are some of the few people who actually used it. When you are sick, you begin to understand the value of life. You watch your friends die with their unfinished dreams and wonder if yours will be the same way. You live life to the fullest because you don't want any regrets. I would argue that these kids are the kids who live the most, because in their short lives they do more than most of us ever will. They deserved more than 4% of cancer research funding, they deserved to live and see the impact they made on the world, they deserved so many things that they can't have anymore- because cancer took it from them. The one thing we can still give them is respect, and they're not getting that right now. They didn't become a tally on a sheet of paper when they left this earth. Their lives had such purpose, purpose that can't be summed up in a single character. Stop treating my kids like statistics, so maybe we can stop them from dying.
