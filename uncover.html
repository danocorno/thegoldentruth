							<h2 class="title">Uncovering the Truth</h2>
							<p class="meta">Posted by Nancy
						
                                <br/>
								<p style="font-size:20px"> </p><p>I get a lot of messages on social media asking me to address various cancer/chronic illness accounts that are dishonest or fake. Girls and boys who are hiding behind their computer screens, pretending to be very sick in hopes of receiving attention, presents, and special trips. I usually ignore these messages, mostly because the goal of The Golden Truth is to create awareness, not drama. I don't want to promote negativity, no matter how much someone deserves it. But I do feel strongly about this topic, and I don't want it to go unnoticed in the pediatric cancer community. So this is my response, for past and future culprits. It is WRONG to fake an illness- for any reason. There is nothing "fun" about being sick, and I blame the media for the many misconceptions about this. 
"Yeah I know what a hospital is like, I saw it on TV!" But what exactly did you see on TV? A child visiting with friends in a hospital room, a heart rate monitor, maybe an IV pole. Did you see the needle stuck in their chest? Did you see them throwing up blood? Did you see the tube in their stomach, the radiation burns on their skin, or the ventilator keeping them alive? Did you hear them cry out in pain, cry for a normal life, cry because they want to DIE? I didn't think so. I can assure you that while "cancer perks" do exist, being sick is not fun. It's scary and it's painful, but who wants to see that in the media?<br/>

Just like dystopia was big right after The Hunger Games came out, hospital life has been in the spotlight ever since The Fault in Our Stars. I personally loved that book. As the movie and John Green in general. (nerdfighters reading- comment DFTBA) I am actually working very hard to get an interview with Mr. Green, because I would love to hear his thoughts about how much he has reshaped childhood cancer awareness. (spoiler alert) As much as I bawled my eyes out when Augustus Waters died, I'm so happy that John Green let that happen. Of course I wanted Hazel and Gus to have their happy ending, but the harsh truth is most kids don't. I don't know too many pediatric cancer couples, but I do know the fate of most people with relapsed osteosarcoma (Augustus' bone tumor) and metastasized tumors in the lungs (Hazel's thyroid cancer). Had Gus and Hazel both lived happily ever after, it would only add to the sugarcoat that The Golden Truth is fighting so hard to eradicate.
<br/>
TFIOS' success has resulted in our society's obsession with the hospital, which is of course pampered by Hollywood to be disgustingly unrealistic. Programs like If I Stay, Red Band Society, and more are viewed by millions and shining light on the thousands of children living with chronic, mental, and terminal illness. I watched Red Band Society, and it is about as far from accurate as you can get. But rather than bash a TV show produced by Spielberg, I will leave it at this: that is not how a hospital works. Part of me is hesitant to write this post, because I know that many people have good intentions by putting sick kids in the media. But there's no hiding the fact that many of these productions do more hurt than help, no matter how good the intention. By putting the hospital on display as a fun, welcoming place to make friends- you're putting the idea in "normal" teenager's heads that being sick is good, desirable even. Like I said in my last post, media is a powerful tool for change. This change isn't always positive. Viewers get so sucked into these shows that they WANT to be sick. Some of them want it badly enough to fake it- tricking friends, family, even doctors.<br/>

This phenomenon has become such a big deal that the medical world has stepped in. Called "Münchausen Syndrome" or "Factitious Disorders", these psychiatric conditions exist when someone exaggerates or invents medical symptoms. There is even a "Münchausen Syndrome by proxy", where parents and caregivers coach others into exaggerating symptoms or force them to go through unnecessary medical procedures. Some intentionally harm their children. People are so caught up with wanting attention, money, gifts, etc. they are willing to put themselves/others through horrible pain. The media lure of a desirable hospital setting doesn't help. These conditions have become so common, that many people (especially young adults) with actual physical problems are sent to psychiatrists before they are allowed to see specialists and run medical tests. Patients who are in desperate need of medical attention are forced to sit in counseling sessions, prolonging their diagnosis and start of treatment dates. Not everyone can afford to waste that time. <br/>

Hospital portrayal in the media is not the only problem here. Our culture itself promotes selfish behavior. In our world, "bigger is better," and we can't get enough of anything- money, attention, etc.<br/>
<br/>-Your friend with cancer got to meet their favorite celebrity? The way to get your idol to notice you is to shave your head...
<br/>-The girl with a feeding tube got to fly to New York? Maybe if I'm sick someone will buy me a plane ticket... 
<br/>-Your friend blew you off to visit a boy in the hospital? Maybe people will pay more attention to me in the ICU... <br/>
<br/>Jealousy takes over, and people begin to wish sickness on themselves, not knowing what that really means. They only know what they want, and who has already gotten it.

<br/>The goal of The Golden Truth is to change the way the world sees pediatric cancer, and to change awareness for the better. I know that there will always be people willing to go to great lengths for money and attention. I know that showing the truth won't solve everything. But it's a step in the right direction, and we desperately need that. For those of you reading who are faking an illness or considering doing so: let this be a wake up call. There are thousands of children around the world fighting for their lives and you are selfishly taking away their chances to SURVIVE. You don't want to walk in their shoes (if they can walk), but they would trade places with you in a heartbeat (which might not be stable). Please think carefully on your actions. If you really want to be involved in this world, create positive change. You have the power to impact the world with your actions- it's your choice whether it's for good or bad. </p>
