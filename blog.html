							<div class="entry">
								<p><img src="images/celena int.jpeg" width="500" height="354" alt="" />This year, we plan on making some big waves in the sea of childhood cancer awareness. We want to make the whole world aware! To make this happen, we have started the #supportTRUTH campaign. Each month, we will give you a way for you to help kids with cancer by raising awareness for the truth - what life is really like for a child with cancer. Post pictures of your challenges using the hashtag #supportTRUTH to tell everyone about your fight against pediatric cancer!Â

								<p style="font-size:20px"> </p><p>Is Starbucks waging a war on Christmas?! All over the news this week, we have heard about #WarOnChristmas. Thousands of people are blowing up their social media - arguing about, yes, a red paper cup. It's not even December, and we're already freaking out about the ornaments missing on our Peppermint Mochas.  The #WarOnChristmas is getting way out of hand.</p>

								<p style="font-size:20px"> </p><p>Happy October! We had an extremely successful Childhood Cancer Awareness month- complete with amazing events and fundraising. We are slowly but steadily turning the world gold, and the childhood cancer community should be proud of the strides we are making toward a cure. Of course, it is not enough. 250 kids are still dying every day, and that's not okay. Awareness doesn't stop here - September is over but we are just getting started! That being said, as October rolls in I want to make an important point: </p>

<p>BREAST CANCER AWARENESS IS NOT OUR ENEMY. <br/>

							<p class="meta">Posted by Nancy Pickett, July 31, 2015
						
                                <br/>
								<p style="font-size:20px"> </p><p>When your child has cancer, everyone in the hospital becomes family. Security guards, janitors, and ER nurses recognize you just because of how frequently you visit the hospital. The hematology/oncology floor is a tight knit community, but they're not the only ones who know the hospital inside out. There are thousands of children living with life altering or life threatening chronic conditions, with little to no known treatments. Just like pediatric cancer patients, these kids miss out on their childhood and can die entirely too early due to dangerous treatments and lack of funding. Some chronic illnesses are treated with chemo, and some are more deadly than many types of cancer. Chronic illness needs awareness too.. So why is The Golden Truth focused entirely on pediatric oncology?<br/>

								<p style="font-size:20px"> </p><p>2015 has been filled with bad news. As of today at least 43,250 children have died from cancer, and to me it feels like more. I can't scroll through any form of social media without reading about a child's funeral, hospice care plan, or relapse. At first I thought this overwhelming amount of bad news was me getting more immersed in this community. But it's not. Pediatric cancer incidence rates are climbing, and so are the number of deaths. The treatments we're using to kill childhood cancer are giving kids more cancer. (Yes, you did read that correctly. Cancer treatments are causing secondary cancer.) And if it's not another cancer, it's heart disease, kidney failure, immune difficiancies, the list goes on. The other day, I had a kid tell me that they felt better before their tumor was found, because the pain from that was less than the pain caused by chemo. That's absolutely unacceptable, and I could list off a million statistics about why! But I'm not going to do that, because these kids are not statistics. They're kids. <br/>

								<p style="font-size:20px"> </p><p>I love to see people's reactions when they first hear about The Golden Truth. I'm a student filmmaker working on a feature length with my best friend, so naturally people assume that my movie is about drugs, sex, violence, or a combination of these. While I am flattered that people think so highly of my cinematic taste level, no one has guessed that my film was about pediatric cancer. Although my age and background adds to their surprise, I contribute most people's initial shock to their lack of understanding when it comes to pediatric oncology.
