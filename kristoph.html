                          <p class="meta">Posted by Kristoph Kennedy, September 25, 2015 <br />
                          </p>
                          <p class="meta"><p style="font-size:20px"> </p><p> <img src="images/kris.jpg" style="float: left; width: 120px; height: 170px; padding-right: 11px;" alt="kris" />My name is Kristoph. You may have previously seen my name as Sydnee Kennedy (or just Syd). As I change my name to Kristoph, I felt our followers deserve an explanation. In as few words as possible, I am a transgender male. To elaborate for those of you who are unsure what that means or what that even is, I was assigned a female gender at birth based off of my physical body parts but I now identify as male. I know this can be hard to grasp for some people, so I thought I would explain what exactly I mean when I say I am transgender, and explain a little bit about being trans.</br>
                          <p>One of the biggest questions I get when people find out I am trans is: “What makes you feel that way?” I wish I could offer you some solid factual explanation about hormones in my brain or differences in brain tissue or some crazy medical reason, but I can’t. As far as I know, there isn’t really something medically wrong with me that would cause me to feel the way I do. I don’t like to think of it as something wrong at all. It wasn’t a choice I made. It was just a feeling I always had but could never put into words. As a child I always felt strange being called a girl or Miss. It made me really uncomfortable for reasons I didn’t understand at the time, and even worse was this large amount of pressure (from both internal and external forces) to be more feminine. Even though I loved to wear shorts and sneakers and baggy T-shirts with a backwards baseball cap, I often felt a need to “appear feminine”, since I was raised to be a girl. I would try to wear skirts and low cut V-necks in compensation. I preferred to hang around masculine boys more than feminine girls, but never really felt okay with being given the title of Tomboy.  
<br/>

<p>The feeling continued through middle school and on into high school. It was just a major discomfort when people tried to force me into dresses and skirts that I did not want to wear. Eventually as puberty hit, I was disappointed to learn that girl’s voices don’t drop. I could ramble on and on about how uncomfortable that all is, but I know that it is hard to understand something that you have never felt. So I am going to try explaining the feeling with an analogy. Imagine being in a world where everyone else is in color and you are in black and white. Everyday when you wake up, the world is still dark (when everything seems as if it is in black and white) and you feel comfortable. But then you have to get up and turn on the light, and all of a sudden everywhere you turn you see color. You remember how dull you look compared to everyone else. You begin to ask yourself, “Why do they get to be colorful, while I’m stuck with dull grey skin and white hair?” You do your best to hide it with colorful jackets, but even with your jacket on it shows through in everyway possible. People can easily identify you as a colorless person. You reach a point where thinking about colors on other people (and your own lack) becomes painful; the pain isn’t only emotional but becomes physical as well.<br/>

<p>In the world of a transgender teenager, I get this feeling every day at varying degrees. The term for this feeling is ‘Dysphoria’. Certain aspects of life help to minimalize Dysphoria, such as being called by pronouns that match your identity or wearing clothes that express your gender. On the flip side, a lot of things make it worse - such as being in a body that feels wrong, being misgendered, or even (for me at least) seeing another guy take his shirt off. Some transgender people experience Dysphoria very little, and some experience it so much that they need counseling. Personally, I can reach a point where I am too upset to be touched. It is that feeling that helps me feel so solidified in my identity.<br/>

<p>I recently attended a summer camp designed as a safe place for teens of the LGTBQIA+ community. While there, we spoke about a very important topic that a lot of people don’t understand. If I could teach every generation of kids one thing in school, it would be the difference between your sex, gender identity, and gender expression. The best way to understand it is through examples, but first I will offer a general definition of each in my own words:<br/>

<p class="entry">
<strong>- Sex</strong> is determined by a person's body parts, whether it is genitals or bone structures, and also by chromosomes. <br/>
<strong>- Gender Identity</strong> is the gender with which they identify, be it none or many. (Yes there are people who identify with more than one, and people who identify as none) <br/>
<strong>- Gender Expression</strong> is how they present themselves through appearance and actions<br/>

<p>For example, my sex is female, but my gender identity is male. As for my gender expression I usually present myself as more masculine but occasionally I come off as androgynous (displaying both masculine and feminine characteristics). As you can see, my three do not match up perfectly. Nancy, however, is a great example of someone whose sex, gender identity, and expression all line up. She was born as, identifies as, and presents herself as female.<br/>

<p>So now that you have (hopefully) a decent understanding of what is going on with me, I will wrap it up with a few simple requests. They are very easy - and require no money! All I ask for is that anyone who addresses me does so using the name Kristoph Kennedy, and traditionally male he/him/his pronouns. I understand that this can be hard to switch, especially if you have been in contact with me before this. So all I really ask is a bit of effort to remember. I am not horribly strict about it, so even if you mess up and correct yourself I’ll appreciate your support!<br/>

<p>I hope this was informative to everyone, and clears up any confusion about my name. I really appreciate everyone who tries to call me Kristoph, and I look forward to continuing to work on The Golden Truth with Nancy.<br/>
